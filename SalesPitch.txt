Spree Shopping – Project Showcase Script

---

1. Introduction & Hook

Hello! My name is [Your Name], and I’m excited to present my project: **Spree Shopping**.
Let me start with a question: Have you ever wished online shopping could be more fun and rewarding? That’s the inspiration behind Spree.

2. The Problem & The Story

Traditional online stores can feel dull and transactional. Imagine a student, Sarah, who shops online but never feels engaged or recognized. Spree changes that by turning shopping into a gamified, interactive experience—where every action earns XP, and levels.

3. Why Trust Spree? (Ethos)

- Built with modern, industry-standard tools: React 19, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Firebase, and Vite.
- Secure authentication and real-time data updates.
- Codebase is well-documented and fully tested using TDD (Test-Driven Development).
- Automated CI/CD pipeline ensures every update is reliable and instantly deployed to Vercel.

4. How It Works (Logos)

- **Authentication:** Register, log in, and reset passwords securely.
- **Product Catalog:** Browse, filter, and view detailed product pages.
- **Cart & Orders:** Add items, adjust quantities, and place orders. Orders are tracked per user and update in real time.
- **Gamification:** Earn XP and level up as you shop—see your progress on your profile.
- **Admin Mode:** Admins can add, edit, or delete products directly from the UI.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on any device, with accessibility features built in.
